# Rock, Paper, Scissors Flask Project

For this week's homework at CodeClan, we were tasked with creating a simple Flask app where users can play the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in their browser via local host!

The pages were styled to look like an old-school game.

### Play in the Address Bar:
The first way to play is in the address bar where you input two choices. The first choice will represent the first player and the second choice will represent the second player. For example, the address bar will have the input `http://127.0.0.1:5000/paper/scissors` and the page will look like this:

The result will blink in green to announce the winner.

### Play Against a Computer:
You can also play against the Computer whose choice will be random.![Screenshot 2022-06-05 at 11 36 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102677016/172048217-718ba7a4-5ef9-423b-af0f-c5c9cea16505.png)

If the user and computer choose the same, it will state it's a draw and blink in a light-peach colour.
